# JFTT-compi
A compiler for a simple imperative programming language.

The language works exclusively on natural numbers and can process the following instructions:
* IF and IF/ELSE statements
* WHILE loops
* FOR loops
* READ and WRITE from/to stdin/stdout

Additionally the language supports both single and array-like variables.

Files in the "labor4" folder have been provided by the lecturer and serve as a compiler testing utility.


This compiler has ranked second out of 85 submitted compilers when scored by output code computational performance.
